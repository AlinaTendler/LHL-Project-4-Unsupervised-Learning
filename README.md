## Project Overview
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment wholesale customers based on their annual spending across various product categories. By identifying distinct customer groups, the business can tailor marketing strategies, optimize inventory, and enhance customer satisfaction.
## Dataset
The dataset contains annual spending (in monetary units) on diverse product categories for clients of a wholesale distributor.
## Project Description:
### Data Preprocessing:

1. Load the dataset.
2. Handle missing values.
3. Detect and remove outliers using the IQR method.
4. Normalize the data using StandardScaler.

### KMeans Clustering:

1. Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
2. Apply KMeans clustering.
3. Visualize the clusters.

### Hierarchical Clustering:

1. Compute linkage matrix.
2. Plot dendrogram to determine the number of clusters.
3. Apply Agglomerative Clustering.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

1. Reduce dimensionality for visualization.
2. Plot the clusters in the PCA-reduced space.
